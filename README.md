Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements for this application was to create a weight tracking application. This application needs the ability to add weight and the date, and also the ability to delete and edit the data. The data will be on a recycler and the edit and delete button should be attached to each piece of data on the recycler. You should also have a functional login screen allowing the user to create an account and login. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The features that are required for my user was the ability to add, delete and edit the data. My design helped support these needs by being simplistic and easy to you. I believe I was succesful because the application is great in giving the user the features they need and a design that supports simplicity

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The process that I chose was first brainstorming all of my requirements and coming up with a plan of attack. Then putting my plan into action! This is a great strategy for the future as it allows me to approach my problems a plan and not going into something with no plan.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I did testing on code every couple lines of code to ensure my intended functionality was what I was getting. This actually revealed many problem to me as I was having major problems with my recycler for a day or two before finally finding a solution.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate on my recycler design as our section on recyclers did not show a break down on the exact design I was looking for. I did a little research and with that I began innvoating my design to be exactly what I wanted.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe my recycler is the componenet that demonstrates my knowledge the most. This is because the recycler was actually very challenging for me to get it the exact way as this is the main activity in my project. This recycler does not do too much but the amount of time I spent getting it exctly how I wanted is extreme undervalued.
